# Clustering European Countries Using K-Means

This project uses the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to group European countries based on various socio-economic and demographic features such as GDP, population, birthrate, and deathrate.

## 📌 Overview

The goal is to explore **unsupervised learning** by applying K-Means to a real-world dataset. By identifying patterns in the data, we can classify countries into clusters with similar characteristics — without using any labels.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes multiple numerical features for each country:
- Country Name
- GDP
- Inflation
- Area
- Military
- lifeexpectancy
- Population growth
- Unemployment

> 📁 File: `Europe_Countries.csv`

## 🧠 Key Steps

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Preprocess and scale the data
3. Determine optimal number of clusters using **Elbow Method**
4. Apply **K-Means Clustering**
5. Visualize the resulting clusters
6. Add cluster labels back to the original dataset

## 📈 Visualizations

- **Elbow Curve** to identify the best number of clusters
- **Scatter plot** showing country clusters in 2D space (first two features or PCA)

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
